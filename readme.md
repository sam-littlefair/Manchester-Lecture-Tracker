## Manchester Lecture Tracker
Chrome extension to track timestamp and completion of lecture videos on the University of Manchester's podcasting website.

The extension automatically skips the video back to where you left off, and remembers the playback speed setting you were watching at.

When you complete a lecture, you will see a green tick next to it.

It also adds various new speed settings: 0.5x, 1.75x, 2.25x, 2.5x, 2.75x and 3x for maximum productivity.

For feature requests or bug reports please open a new issue :)

This extension can be found on the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manchester-lecture-tracke/jlijaagcfkmcokjnkjpcbbimjanngnol).
